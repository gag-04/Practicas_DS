  Cita: “This life is what you make it. No matter what, you're going to mess up sometimes,
    it's a universal truth. But the good part is you get to decide how you're going
    to mess it up. Girls will be your friends - they'll act like it anyway. But just
    remember, some come, some go. The ones that stay with you through everything -
    they're your true best friends. Don't let go of them. Also remember, sisters make
    the best friends in the world. As for lovers, well, they'll come and go too. And
    baby, I hate to say it, most of them - actually pretty much all of them are going
    to break your heart, but you can't give up because if you give up, you'll never
    find your soulmate. You'll never find that half who makes you whole and that goes
    for everything. Just because you fail once, doesn't mean you're gonna fail at
    everything. Keep trying, hold on, and always, always, always believe in yourself,
    because if you don't, then who will, sweetie? So keep your head high, keep your
    chin up, and most importantly, keep smiling, because life's a beautiful thing
    and there's so much to smile about.”

  Cita: “You may not be her first, her last, or her only. She loved before she may
    love again. But if she loves you now, what else matters? She's not perfect—you
    aren't either, and the two of you may never be perfect together but if she can
    make you laugh, cause you to think twice, and admit to being human and making
    mistakes, hold onto her and give her the most you can. She may not be thinking
    about you every second of the day, but she will give you a part of her that she
    knows you can break—her heart. So don't hurt her, don't change her, don't analyze
    and don't expect more than she can give. Smile when she makes you happy, let her
    know when she makes you mad, and miss her when she's not there.”
